# HousingPricePrediction

This is a project that uses Data analysis libraries, and Supervised Machine Learning Libraries to predict prices of houses in the city of California. Data was extracted from Kaggle.com.

Data Analysis Libraries: Numpy, Panadas, MatplotLib and Seaborn The above libraries were used for exploration, Cleaning,visualization and preprocessing of the dataset.

Feature Engineering was performed for higher accuracy and the features were scaled as well

In the end we used 2 machine learning models during evaluation
